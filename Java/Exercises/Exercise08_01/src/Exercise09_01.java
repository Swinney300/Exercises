/*(The Rectangle class) 
Following the example of the Circle class in Section 9.2, design a class named Rectangle to represent a rectangle.

The class contains:
- Two double data fields named width and height that specify the width 
and height of the rectangle. The default values are 1 for both width and height.

- A no-arg constructor that creates a default rectangle.
- A constructor that creates a rectangle with the specified width and height.
- A method named getArea() that returns the area of this rectangle.
- A method named getPerimeter() that returns the perimeter.

Draw the UML diagram for the class and then implement the class.
Write a test program that creates two Rectangle objectsâ€”one with width 4 
and height 40 and the other with width 3.5 and height 35.9.

Display the width, height, area, and perimeter of each rectangle in this order.

Sample Run

The area of a rectangle with width 4.0 and height 40.0 is 160.0

The perimeter of a rectangle is 88.0

The area of a rectangle with width 3.5 and height 35.9 is 125.64999999999999

The perimeter of a rectangle is 78.8
